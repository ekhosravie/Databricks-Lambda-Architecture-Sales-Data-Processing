Databricks Lambda Architecture - Sales Data Processing
This document outlines a Lambda architecture for processing sales data in Databricks. The architecture separates data processing into three layers:

Batch Layer: Handles historical data in bulk (e.g., daily). It reads raw sales data from storage (like parquet files), performs basic transformations (filtering recent data), and writes the results to a Delta table.

Speed Layer: Processes real-time sales data using structured streaming. It reads data from a Kafka topic containing sales information, filters for recent data (e.g., last hour), and writes the stream to a separate Delta table.

Serving Layer: Provides a unified view of both batch and real-time data for querying. It reads data from both Delta tables and combines them using temporary views. This layer allows for queries that combine historical and recent sales data.

Benefits:

Real-time Insights: Speed layer processes data quickly, enabling near real-time analysis of sales trends.
Historical Analysis: Batch layer ensures comprehensive historical data is available for in-depth analysis.
Flexibility: Architecture allows independent development and maintenance of each layer.
Note: This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes. A real-world implementation would involve additional considerations and best practices.
